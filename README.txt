Carallel macros provide a way to quickly and easily parallelize blocks of code inside methods.
Currently only very basic functionality is implemented.
Methods that can have parallelized code blocks must have declaration like:
  void foo( void ).
See demo.c for sample usage of the macros.
Last, but not least, have fun with this project.
